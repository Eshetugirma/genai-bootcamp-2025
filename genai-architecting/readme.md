# OromoX: AI-Powered English & Oromo Learning for Ethiopia’s Education Sector

## 1. Overview

Ethiopia’s education system serves millions of students, yet traditional teaching methods often limit practical **English proficiency** and access to quality **Oromo language** education.

**OromoX** is an **AI-driven language learning platform** designed to enhance **English & Afaan Oromo** education by leveraging **interactive AI tutors, speech recognition, and adaptive learning**, tailored to Ethiopia’s diverse classrooms.

### Key Focus Areas

- **Oromo-to-English & English-to-Oromo**   (bidirectional learning)  
- **AI-powered speaking & pronunciation training**   for real-world fluency  
- **Adaptive AI tutors**   that reduce teacher workload & boost engagement  
- **Integration with school management systems**  
- **Data security compliant with Ethiopian privacy standards**

## 2. Project Requirements

This project aligns with the **GenAI Architecting Bootcamp** specifications. The goal is to create architectural diagrams as **teaching aids** to help stakeholders understand **GenAI workloads**. These diagrams aim to:

- **Visualize technical paths** and uncertainties in adopting AI.  
- **Encourage discussions** on infrastructure, integration, and dependencies.  
- **Follow structured architecture methodologies**, such as **TOGAF, C4 Model, and conceptual/logical/physical design approaches**.

For full details, see **[docs/project-requirements.md](docs/project-requirements.md)**.

## 3. Business Case

### 📊 Ethiopia’s Education Sector: A Growing Opportunity

- **50M+ students** enrolled in Ethiopia’s education system (primary to tertiary).  
- **11,000+ schools** operate nationwide, with a focus on multilingual education.  
- **English proficiency is critical**, yet rural access and teaching methods lag.  

### 🌍 The Global & Local Demand for Afaan Oromo

- **40M+ native speakers** of Afaan Oromo in Ethiopia and the diaspora.  
- Oromo is Ethiopia’s **most widely spoken language**, yet digital learning tools are scarce.  
- AI-driven solutions can enhance **access & personalization** for Oromo learners.
